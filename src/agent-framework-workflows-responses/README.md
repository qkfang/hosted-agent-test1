# Multi-Agent Workflow (Responses Protocol)

An [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) workflow demonstrating **multi-agent chaining**, hosted on Microsoft Foundry using the **Responses protocol**. It shows how to use the Agent Framework's `WorkflowBuilder` to compose a pipeline of specialized agents — a slogan writer, a legal reviewer, and a formatter — that process a request sequentially. Each agent receives only the output of the previous agent, and only the final formatted result is returned to the caller.

> This sample requires a more advanced model because the model needs to continue the conversation from an assistant message. Not all models perform well in this scenario. Tested with OpenAI's model `gpt-5.4`.

## How it works

The agent creates three specialized `Agent` instances sharing the same `FoundryChatClient`: a **writer** that generates slogans, a **legal reviewer** that ensures compliance, and a **formatter** that styles the output. Each agent is wrapped in an `AgentExecutor` with `context_mode="last_agent"` so it only sees the previous agent's output. The `WorkflowBuilder` wires them into a linear pipeline and limits the output to the formatter's result. The workflow is converted to a standard agent via `.as_agent()` and served via `ResponsesHostServer`. See [main.py](main.py) for the implementation.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the AI agent extension:
   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```
3. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir my-workflow-agent && cd my-workflow-agent

azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/python/hosted-agents/agent-framework/responses/05-workflows/agent.manifest.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

In a separate terminal, from the project directory:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "Create a slogan for a new electric SUV that is affordable and fun to drive."
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "Create a slogan for a new electric SUV that is affordable and fun to drive."
```

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-ai-foundry)** extension installed.
2. Sign in to Azure in VS Code.

### Create the project

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Create Hosted Agent**.
2. Select this sample from the gallery. The extension scaffolds the project into a new workspace and generates `agent.yaml`, `.env`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` + `launch.json` automatically.
3. Complete the **Foundry Project Setup** to pick the subscription and Foundry project (or create a new one).

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent in debug mode. The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Test with Agent Inspector

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**.
2. The Inspector connects to the running agent. Send messages to chat and view streamed responses.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.
